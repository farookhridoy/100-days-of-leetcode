540. Single Element in a Sorted Array

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10

Algorithm:

step 1 : If array have only 1 element then the problem is already solved.
step 2 : Make a temp array the size of original array.
step 3 : Loop the array and check each elements with there next element and compare both
         -> if the both elements are same then go to the next elements
         -> If not match then save the element in the temp array
step 4 : Return the temp array
